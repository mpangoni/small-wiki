Decision Making Process 

* What factors do you consider in a hand?  

* What questions do you ask yourself in a hand?  

* Do you consider these factors or ask these questions in the same order every time, or are they in an order that fits the hand?  

* What factors do you fail to consider when your mind isnâ€™t as sharp? 

* What are the most common ways your decision making breaks down?
