<p>A- to C-game Analysis  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Brainstorm and gather notes about each level that your game has reached over the last three to six months (or another sample size that gives you an accurate snapshot of your current range). Think back to previous hands, sessions, and tournaments that you’ve played. What is your mental game like, and what are the obvious mistakes you make when at your absolute worst? What mistakes do you make when you’re playing decently? How do you experience tilt when it's manageable and not overwhelming? </p>
<p></p>
<p>What is the first tactical mistake and mental issue that indicate you’ve fallen out of the zone? Even if they’re basic, include all the things you do tactically and mentally at all levels of play.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* If you are struggling to determine your greatest weaknesses, get a friend or coach to help you identify them. Also, make sure that your true C-game isn’t being concealed by quitting, a stop-loss, being staked, or simply not playing. This is not suggesting that you put yourself in spots where you could lose a lot of money just for the sake of evaluating your game. Instead, try and predict the mistakes that would be made if you tilted really badly, lost more buy-ins than you’d like, were playing with your own bankroll, or played on a day when you felt less than perfect.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Categorize your notes from the first step using your zone profile as a starting point. The level of detail you recorded determines the number of categories. If you found a lot of detail, consider using a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the zone and 1 is your absolute worst. If you found less detail, consider using the common A- to C-game scale. You may find it easier to define the outer extremes of your range—best and worst—and then work your way in. If you’re struggling to categorize the variations in your game, keep at it. Completing this A- to C-game analysis is similar to the zone profile, and may take you several weeks or even longer to complete.   </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Define your tactical and mental game range together so you can see how they relate. If you have two or more mental game issues, consider doing separate analyses for each issue. That way, you can see the effect that each mental game issue has on your tactical decision making. </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Study your range as you would any poker concept that you were trying to master.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Review your range during your cool-down and add new details as you notice progress. </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Review your range during your warm-up so it’s fresh in your mind. This makes finding new details easier.   </p>
